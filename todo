### Server

- [ ] Debug the watchdog module. It has some weird behavior.
- [ ] Dynamically add files as they are being processed. Current behavior is: process all, then add them at once. This can cause impatience in case of lots of files.
- [ ] Add settings module
- [ ] In case of duplicates, select the higher bitrate track
- [ ] Add and deploy demo branch

### Client
- [ ] Add processes tab to show running tasks, eg. when tagging files. I have no idea on how to go about it so far. Web sockets? 
- [ ] Responsiveness, especially the track list.
- [ ] Make dummy buttons functional.
- [ ] Add settings page (or modal)
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts listing page (or modal)
- [ ] Add backspace shortcut to go back.
- [ ] Implement Esc key to cancel modals.


### Notes

- Maybe first process tags and store them to the database, then process albums from these tags.

Like,this:
1. Tag files
2. Insert all into the database
3. Fetch all albums
4. Fetch all tracks
5. Create prealbums
6. Pop all processed albums
7. Use the following procedure to process single album image:
    7.1. Get a single album track, pop it from memory
    7.2. Try ripping image,
        (i). if successful: hurray! we won't have to go further.
        (ii). if failed, try getting another track from the same album, try ripping image.
        (iii). If failed, repeat (ii) until success, or until you run out of tracks. In that case, set album image to fallback.
